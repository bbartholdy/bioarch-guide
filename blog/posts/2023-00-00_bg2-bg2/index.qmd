The Bioarchaeologist's Guide has this to say on the subject of
The Bioarchaeologist's Guide:

## Hello World

This is the inaugural post for *The Bioarchaeologist's Guide*. The topic
of this post will be *The Bioarchaeologist's Guide*. How it came to be,
what will be its purpose, and who is this Bjørn person anyway?

## How it came to be

I have a bunch of notes on various topics that I wanted to share.
Now I'm sharing them. That's it.

## What will be its purpose

The purpose of this site... blog... whatever it ends up being, is to
provide a set of helpful resources on common topics in the field of
bioarchaeology. Some may be interesting, others won't. Some may be
broadly applicable to many fields, others won't. Topics will include
**dental diseases**, **statistics**, the **R programming language**,
and **open science**. It will not contain any entries on The Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Galaxy, but there will be quotes.

I have done my best to make sure this site... blog... thing, will be as
accessible as possible. The colours were generated using
[randoma11y](https://randoma11y.com/) and are chosen for their high contrast.
The primary theme was styled after the BBC television adaptation of the
Hitchhiker's Guide, but there is also a secondary theme with a lower contrast
and [Atkinson Hyperlegible Font](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont)
(themes can be accessed using the switch in the navigation bar). I will also
make sure that all images have alt text.

## Who is this Bjørn person anyway?

I am a human, and the errors will reflect that (and I'm genuinely happy
to have them pointed out). I'm a PhD student doing bioarchaeology. I also
dabble in Open Science and statistics.

Well, that about wraps it up for this post.
