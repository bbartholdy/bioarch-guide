::: {#hero-heading}

A guide to life, the universe and everything. Well, actually that scope is
probably a bit wide. A guide to a range of topics that may be useful
in the very small field of bioarchaeology, and some that may even be useful
in other fields of study.

:::

## Accessibility

The default theme is high-contrast, but is mainly styled after the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (the TV series).
A more accessible theme is available if you use the 'dark mode' switch in the top right corner (top left on mobile).
This theme uses softer colours (but still distinguishable) and the
[Atkinson Hyperlegible font](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/).
