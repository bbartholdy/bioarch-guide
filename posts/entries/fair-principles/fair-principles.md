**[F]{.x-large}indable** means you can actually locate the (meta)data. This
requires the data to be:

- assigned a persistent identifier (PID)
- accompanied by metadata
- registered in a searchable resource.

**[A]{.x-large}ccessible** means there should be a clear path to accessing
the (meta)data. Preferably accessible via:

- an open, standardised protocol. 
- restricted access (authentication), if necessary.

**[I]{.x-large}nteroperable** means the (meta)data should be in a format that allows
them to be used in common applications and workflows, preferably with:

- formal, accessible, broadly applicable language
- vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
- references to other related (meta)data

**[R]{.x-large}eusable** means the data should be well-documented, including:

- domain-relevant guidance using community standards for researchers who wish to reuse the
data
- provenance of their creation
- a license to indicate the terms of reuse
