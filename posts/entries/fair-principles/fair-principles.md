The FAIR Data Principles were created as guidelines to
making data more reusable, both by humans and machines.
FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and
Reusable.

[F]{.x-large}indable means you can actually locate the (meta)data. This
requires the data to be assigned a persistent identifier (PID).
The data should be accompanied by metadata, which are
registered in a searchable resource.

[A]{.x-large}ccessible means there should be a clear path to accessing
the (meta)data. Preferably an open, standardised protocol. Access
can be restricted, if necessary.

[I]{.x-large}nteroperable means the data should be in a format that allows
them to be used in common applications and workflows, preferably
an open source format. The metadata for assets should also use
agreed-upon community standards.

[R]{.x-large}eusable means the data should be well-documented. This includes
domain-relevant guidance for researchers who wish to reuse the
data, and a provenance of their creation. A license should be
used to indicate the terms of reuse, such as a
[creative commons](https://creativecommons.org/) license.
